            <h3>Progress in AI-Based Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p>My initial ventures into AI, such as the 'Basic Loan Eligibility Classifier' (see Project A), laid the groundwork for understanding fundamental programming concepts and data interaction. Developed using foundational Python libraries and simple rule-based logic, this project was a crucial step in grasping how to process financial inputs and generate basic outcomes. While functional, it might reveal a simpler approach to feature engineering and limited adaptability to diverse applicant profiles. This early work taught me the importance of clean data handling and the basics of conditional logic in decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Real-time Chat Application</h3>
            <p>The most significant area of growth, perhaps, has been in tackling full-stack development and complex data structures. My latest capstone project, (see Project C), is a testament to this progress. This project required me to design and implement a robust backend using Node.js and Express, integrate WebSockets for real-time communication, and manage a MongoDB database. Unlike my earlier projects, this involved architecting an entire system, from authentication and user management to data persistence and scalable real-time messaging. The challenges here were multi-faceted: ensuring data integrity, managing concurrent connections, and deploying the application to a cloud platform. The evolution from client-side scripting to comprehensive server-side development and database management is a clear indicator of my expanding capabilities.</p>
