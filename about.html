    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing a four-year Bachelor’s degree at Midlands State University, which I began in 2024. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems and improve lives. My academic journey so far has deepened my interest in areas like software development, artificial intelligence, and data-driven systems.</p><br>
    <p>I'm currently working on a number of personal and academic projects that explore innovative tech solutions, with plans to publish and share them soon. Beyond the classroom, I enjoy experimenting with code, learning new tools, and staying up to date with the latest in tech and innovation. I’m eager to grow as a developer, collaborate with other creatives and problem-solvers, and eventually contribute meaningfully to the global tech community.</p>
    <p>Feel free to check out my academic projects <a href="progress.html">here</a>.</p><hr>
